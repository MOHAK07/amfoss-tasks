About my tasks

The tasks were really good and challenging although i have not done many of them but almost seven tasks i have done .  These tasks help me a lot in learning about new softwares and how to use them and also how to approach new problems and languages and the errors that I came across while solving these tasks . Its a totally new experience for me and the tasks were also new to me but I tried my best to solve these tasks , although I am not having much knowledge about the languages but still tried as much as I can.



Who's me ?
I am basically from kota , Rajasthan . Earlier i don't have much interest in computer science but right from class 9th I started getting involved in computers and also I started to learn about new techs and how they works . my interest started increasing in computers and learniing about latest technologies . My answer about why i joined amrita , amritapuri campus only is firstly because of the amfoss club and the environment in the campus , I had many options during the college selection process but at first sight i liked amrita and its culture also, so i joined amrita to pursue my higher studies in computer science . I joined computer science only because my interest got developed although I don't know much about it as i didn't study computers in my 11th and 12th standard because of the competitive exams . And joining amFOSS will help me a lot in building my learning skill and also increases my knowledge in the things that i am willing to do and the most important it helps me to be a good human being as well it also helps me to overcome my hesitation of interacting with the new people and how to deal with the new problems and situation and how to overcome it in future.
