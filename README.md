About my tasks

The tasks were really good and challenging although i have not done many of them but almost seven tasks i have done .  These tasks help me a lot in learning about new softwares and how to use them and also how to approach new problems and languages and the errors that I come across while solving these tasks . Its a totally new experience for me and the tasks were also new to me but I tried my best to solve these tasks , although I am not having much knowledge about the languages but still tried as much as I can.
