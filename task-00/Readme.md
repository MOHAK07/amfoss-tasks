I have done with the task of ubuntu .

I have made a flash drive of ubuntu using a software and run ubuntu on my pc using the flash drive and uploaded the image of ubuntu but the image is little big in size so you can download it first and then it is clearly visible.

Doing this first time , so faced some problems but not so much and finally its done.

Here is the link for my uploaded image:
