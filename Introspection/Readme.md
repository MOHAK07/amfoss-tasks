INTROSPECTION

Why must we choose you ?

Firstly i love coding and have a great interst in learning new languages and doing sone creative work and also learning about different softwares and exploring new things. as i am bit lazy in doing work and sometimes forget to some important work ....so if you choose me i can be more active than now and by joining the club may be i will interact more with the club members as in daily life i am little bit shy in interacting with people and it also helps to me in building my thinking skills. there are a lot of things that i will improve in myself and also it helps me to increse my knowledge if i join amFOSS club.

What is your plan for the next 6 months ?

Doing some creative works and working on some new projects that i will do for the first time and also to do better in regular academics and want to make my parents happy by geeting good CGPA in amrita.

How would you contribute back to the club ?

First to give my best if i join the club and also to help my club friends if they are getting any issues in solving some tasks that i know or done already and also helping the new members in the club that will join amFOSS in future and if i got the chance to select the new members i will definately help the club by taking right members who are willing to join in the coming four years.

Do you have any feedback for the selection process ?

I am not sure about giving the feedback for the selection process as it is new for me but i like the process as it helps me to go through the differnt softwares and websities and learning about new things and it also helps me in exploring new and new things but i suggest that everyone should get the tasks that he/she is capable of by knowing about there backgrounds in academics and also about their previous knowledge and make an option in the registration form that we fill before getting the tasks for the selection process and then provide them with the tasks. Thats all i have to say about the selection process.
