I have tried this task but can't complete this task because I am not familiar to java language .

First I updated the package index , then I check if jave is already installed or not , in my case it is not installed on my ubuntu desktop .

So I first install java on ubuntu using some simple steps with the help of the website (about how to install java and java tutorials) given in the task description.

Then I copy that link given in the task from which I got the code and a seperate java file is generated in my pc .

After that I opened that file and first analyze the code and then run the code in the terminal and got the errors in the code by running the code.

But I understood only some of the errors like of missing semicolon etc. but I couldn't figure out the syantax erros and not able to understand properly so I didn't continue with the task . so that's all I have tried.
