I tried to do bandit task in windows first using the putty software but i am getting some problems in it in running or something like that i didnt remember that as my system was old at that time but after getting the new pc i first made a flash drive of ubuntu and then tried it and got successful and i understands it easily as going further and further and sometimes takes help from the youtube also where i got stuck like after level 6 , because for getting the password for level 7 we have to use some strings commands ...so there i got stuck and with help of youtube and google i understand somethings about strings and how to use it in that level and by this i ended the task by getting the password for level 11 and about the task was pretty intresting .
